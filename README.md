# Python Api Challenge
APIs make it easy to extract data from websites efficiently and use it for various analyses without much hassle with raw data. This project has two parts, each using different APIs for distinct analyses.

## WeatherPy
In the first part, the OpenWeather API is used to gather weather data for 600+ cities, and scatter plots are created to compare latitude with measures like temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed, seeking trends in geographical weather. 

## VacationPy
The second part uses the Geoapify API to find hotels near cities that have desired weather conditions. The cities and hotel names are displayed on interactive maps.
